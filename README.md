### What I learned

I had a challenge that made me almost give up on the challenge which might seem little but was a bit frustrating and exciting all at the same time. I finally solved it and now I have a solution for everyone who has the same. The challenge was difficulty deploying even when the build and dev was running completely and correctly.

The solution was simply to change the components folder from a pascal-casing to lower-casing.
